##  Getting Started

### Step 1: Verify Everything Works
```bash
python -c "
from src.data_pipeline import DataStorageManager
from src.feature_engineering import QlibAlpha158, FeatureStore
import pandas as pd

# Load data
storage = DataStorageManager()
df = storage.query_ohlcv(symbols=['RELIANCE'])
if isinstance(df.index, pd.MultiIndex):
    df = df.reset_index(level=0, drop=True)

# Generate factors
generator = QlibAlpha158()
factors = generator.generate_all_factors(df)
print(f' {len([c for c in factors.columns if c.startswith(\"factor_\")])} factors generated')

# Store
store = FeatureStore()
store.create_schema()
rows = store.store_factors(factors, symbol='RELIANCE')
print(f' {rows} rows stored')
"
```

### Step 2: Generate Factors for Your Stocks
```bash
# Generate for top 5 stocks
python scripts/generate_factors.py --symbols "RELIANCE,TCS,INFY,HDFCBANK,ICICIBANK" --years 1
```

### Step 3: Query and Use Factors
```python
from src.feature_engineering import FeatureStore

store = FeatureStore()
factors = store.get_factors(['RELIANCE'], include_regimes=True)

# Use for ML training
X = factors[[c for c in factors.columns if c.startswith('factor_')]]
print(f"Features ready: {X.shape}")
```
